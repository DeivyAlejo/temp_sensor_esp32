# ESP32 Temperature & Humidity Logger with OLED Display and MQTT

This project logs temperature and humidity readings using a **DHT11 sensor**, displays the values on an **SSD1306 OLED screen**, and publishes the data to an **MQTT broker** over Wi-Fi using an **ESP32**. After sending the data, the ESP32 enters **deep sleep** to save power, making it ideal for low-energy IoT applications.
